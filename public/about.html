    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>What do i have to say about myself?. I guess i've never had to think aout it, i just exist and try my best to navigate life. Umm, my name is Fadhili, a 5'7 male from Kenya, AFRICA. Normally people call me short even if i'm juast
      a few inches shorter than them, and a lot others taller. My aim in life is to gain peace, when it comes to alot of things. I loath worrying, i want to be stress free for a most part of my life. Especially in terms of inancial freedom, 
      getting to marry a good partner, having a beautiful home, a happy family and many more that i can't let you know of at the moment. I believe wealth isn't only in financial terms, but in also many many other ways.
      I'm currently in university studying a degree in computer science. To be more specific i'm in the University of Nairobi, which is basicaly an African Ivy(yes i had to add that).I'm currently 18 years of age, i'm dark in compexion but not too dark soo don't worry, you can turn off the light in my presence, 
      I won't scare you(creepy smile emoji). I chose computer science because ever since i  was young, i've had a chronic interest in computers, especially smartphones. My dream smartphone, as is of most African people, is an iPhone.
      One day i'll be rich enough to buy one, maybe even seven. But for now, my android will have to do, and honestly it's not neven that bad, it's the market brainwash or whatever it's called. I've said alot about me and i bet right now you feel like we could go camping and sing kumbaya, i won't refuse, as long s i have a gun and a
      working car cause i'm not dying before marriage, i'd normally say a virgin but my gf took that away from me, just like my sanity; but ni really love that woman, and i'd honestly wan to marry her id the future allows it. Well i believe that's enough, you know me well enough. And in case you're an employer i'm mad hardworking and diligent as long as the compensation for my hardwork is adequate. Thank you for your time.
